He gets on with life as a academic,
He's a grumpy kinda chap.
He likes listening to music and racing snails.
He likes to contemplate studying.
But when he starts to daydream,
His mind turns straight to socialising.
Five six seven eight...

Sometimes I look at him and I look into his eyes,
I notice the way he thinks about socialising with a smile,
Curved lips he just can't disguise.
But he thinks it's studying making his life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for him to decide which he loves more?
Studying or...
Socialising?

He likes to use words like 'freak' and 'cheers.'
He likes to use words about studying.
But when he stops his talking,
His mind turns straight to socialising.

Five six seven eight.......

Sometimes I look at him and I look into his eyes,
I notice the way he thinks about socialising with a smile,
Curved lips he just can't disguise.
But he thinks it's studying making his life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for him to decide which he loves more?
Studying or...
Socialising?

He likes to hang out with Katy and Joe.
But when left alone,
His mind turns straight to socialising.

Sometimes I look at him and I look into his eyes,
I notice the way he thinks about socialising with a smile,
Curved lips he just can't disguise.
But he thinks it's studying making his life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for him to decide which he loves more?
Studying or...
Socialising?

He hates headless chickens and teenyboppers.
But he just thinks back to socialising,
And he's happy once again.

Five six seven eight...
